# FetchTakeHomeAssignment
Repository where I have stored the code necessary to complete my **Fetch Take-Home Exercise â€” Site Reliability Engineering solution**. I have completed the solution in Python 3.11.

In order to run my solution:
- Clone repository to your chosen evironment.
- I used a virtual env for my installs imports. I recommend you do the same, however if you want to install locally I suppose you could.
- Run _**pip install -r requirements.txt**_ , if the versionings happen to haved updated:
  - Navigate to env or path you aim to install packages at and run _**pip install PyYAML, requests**_
- Ensure the file path of the YAML file is correct (line 88)
- Save file and run _**python SiteReliability.py**_ from the terminal

As shown in the console, press Cntrl+C to terminate the program. 
The availability percentages for each domain will print in the console, testing every 15 seconds as directed.
Aside from the initial prompt, the output should be in the correct format as specified in the prompt.
